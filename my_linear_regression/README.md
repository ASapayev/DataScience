# Welcome to My Linear Regression
***

## Task
In this task, we will create a program that tests models for Machine Learning and the accuracy of these models.

## Description
We write the LeastSquaresRegression and GradientDescentOptimizer modules from scratch.

## Installation
In order for our program to run, we install the numpy library. 
In addition, we install the matplotlib library for ourselves. 
Matplotlib helps us understand data better when writing program.

## Usage
Our program is ready to work. 
All you have to do is give an argument to the required function.

```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
