# Welcome to My Ds Babel

## Task
In this project we will work with two (SQL and CSV) data types. 
Our task is to transfer data from SQL to CSV and from CSV to SQL

## Description
As always, the Pandas library helped me a lot in this task. 
I have easily transferred data from CSV to SQL and from SQL to CSV using pandas.

## Installation
Naturally, we need to install SQLite3 and pandas libraries first to perform this task.

## Usage
When this program is started, our two functions (sql_to_csv and csv_to_sql) will start doing their work. 
You call the function you need and give it arguments. 
And it will give you the answer YOU EXPECT.

```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
