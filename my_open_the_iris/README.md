# Welcome to My Open The Iris
***

## Task
I completed the tasks in sequence based on the given link. 
Since I already knew ML and the tasks were explained in a step-by-step, simple way, this task was not difficult.

## Description
My partner and I studied and shared the assignment. 
In the end, we combined the code we both wrote and got the result we needed.

## Installation
We used pandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn libraries in the project. 
We cleaned the data using pandas. And the Matplotlib library helps us visualize the data. 
This helps to better understand the problem. We needed the Sklearn library to create models using ML algorithms.

## Usage
Our program consists of several functions. We have a link and we will use it. 
Then our functions will run sequentially and pass us the result.

```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
