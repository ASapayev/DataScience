## Task
In this assignment, we need to create a model that predicts house prices in Boston.

## Description
We first went through the data with our team and cleaned it up.

## Installation
We used the pandas library for data processing, the sklearn library for model training, 
and the matplotlib and seaborn libraries for visual data analysis.
## Usage
As soon as the program is launched, it downloads the data through the link given to it. 
Processes information based on a given sequence. And finally, with the ready data, our model is trained. 
Assessment results are calculated at the end of the program.
