# Welcome to My Mobapp Studio
***

## Task
In this project, we'll work with a dataset of apps from the Google Play Store. 
Our goal is to sort the apps in the store by different ratings.
## Description
I worked with my partner on this project. 
You can get acquainted with the results of both of us through the links in the link_to_blog_post.txt file.
## Installation
Data exploration and preprocessing: Libraries like pandas and numpy help us understand and prepare us data.

Visualization and interpretability: matplotlib and seaborn aid in visualizing us data and understanding the relationships between features and the target variable.

```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
```

## Usage
This program can be run in jupyter notebook or any interactive python notebook (.ipynb).
All functions are written in the correct order. 
All you have to do is use the cells in order.

```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
