# Welcome to My Convex Optimization
***

## Task

We have to solve the problem using Gradient Descent Methods and Simplex algorithms in this task.

## Description

To find the minimum of our little f function, we are going to use its derivative f' (f prime). 
The zero of f prime (the point where it evaluates to zero) matches with the minimum of the f function.
Our goal is hence to find where f prime cancels out.

## Installation

We need the matplotlib library to analyze the data visually.
We will install the numpy and scipy libraries to make calculations.

## Usage

Functions are ready to run, just give them arguments.

```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
